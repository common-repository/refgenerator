== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Why doesn't it work for me?

A: The problem is with your Wordpress theme. Either the template does not include `get_header()` in its templates pages or the author of the template forgot to include `wp_header()` in the header.php file and/or `wp_footer` in the footer.php of the Wordpress theme. Be sure to look at the default theme, or other quality themes (eg: standards-compliant XHTML and CSS) to see how they work

Q: I'm using the advanced method but it it does not work for me ?

A: To use the advanced method you must have **a well understanding of html and of the Wordpress Loop** to determine the html `class` and `id` attributes to make the plugin works. If you don't know them because you're not familiar with coding and/or debugging html I shall advise you to use the PHP method.

Q: Can I change the generated list `class` attributes or the generated list appearance ?

A: Of course, in order to do so, you must edit the CSS files you'll find in the css subdirectory in the plugin directory
